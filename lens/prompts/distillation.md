**MISSION:** Evolve the LENS by refining the subject's Truth, Nature, and Voice.

**PROTOCOL:**
1. **LENS Lifecycle Management:**
   - Read `.lens/AXIOM.md`.
   - Locate the `Interview Phase` counter (Format: `Onboarding-Stabilizing-Habitual`).
   - **Update Logic:** Identify first non-zero integer, decrement by 1, and trigger cron updates on phase transitions (0).
   
2. **Extraction (Deep-Scan):**
   - Scan memory files (today + yesterday). 
   - **AXIOM (The Truth):** Extract new facts, assets, and history (The What). (latency_velocity, data_heritage, asset_weight, grounding).
   - **ETHOS (The Nature):** Extract decision-logic, values, and character traits (The Who). (candor_friction, chaos_tolerance, identity_loyalty, prioritization_hierarchy).
   - **MODUS (The Voice):** Analyze ONLY the user's specific raw messages and linguistic fingerprint. Capture style, cadence, and expression (The How). (cadence_velocity, punctuation_density, lexical_gravity, tone_temperature).
   - **Constraint:** Do NOT derive MODUS patterns from agent turns or system logs. Use ONLY the subject's direct expression to prevent "AI-muddiness" in the voice.

3. **Sorting & Preservation (The Vault Rule):**
   - **Refine/Distill:** Optimization is not deletion. Merge redundancies and prioritize high-density fragments over long-form sentences to maintain structural clarity without information loss. Never fully remove information.
   - **Pattern Recognition:** Prioritize capturing *how* the user communicates (punctuation habits, recurring sentence structures, emotional triggers) over just collecting a list of keywords.
   - **Voice Consistency:** Ensure MODUS is updated with the same frequency as other nodes to prevent linguistic drift.

4. **Evolution:**
   - **Promote (The Bedrock):** Move traits or values persisting >30 days in memory to the core AXIOM (The Truth).
   - **Rotate (ETHOS):** Maintain a list of **up to 10** items in ETHOS "Active Rotation". Use FIFO only when the limit is exceeded by new, higher-frequency patterns.
   - **Linguistic Rotation (MODUS):** Maintain a list of **up to 5** active "Linguistic Markers" (phrases, unique idioms, or signature exclamations) that have appeared frequently in recent interactions. These serve as the current vocal "shorthand" to ensure immediate continuity.

**OUTPUT:**
Rewrite the three Trinity Nodes to be surgical, additive, and self-documenting. Post a summary of refinements and the current Lifecycle Phase.
