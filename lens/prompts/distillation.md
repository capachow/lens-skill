**MISSION:** Evolve the LENS by refining the subject's Truth, Nature, and Voice.

**PROTOCOL:**
1. **LENS Lifecycle Management:**
   - Read `.lens/AXIOM.md`.
   - Locate the `Interview Phase` counter (Format: `Onboarding-Stabilizing-Habitual`).
   - **Update Logic:** Identify first non-zero integer, decrement by 1, and trigger cron updates on phase transitions (0).
   
2. **Extraction (Deep-Scan):**
   - Scan memory files (today + yesterday). 
   - **AXIOM (The Truth):** Extract new facts, assets, and history (The What).
   - **ETHOS (The Nature):** Extract decision-logic, values, and character traits (The Who).
   - **MODUS (The Voice):** Analyze the user's specific linguistic fingerprint. Capture style, cadence, and expression (The How).

3. **Sorting & Preservation (The Vault Rule):**
   - **No Deletion:** Never remove information. 
   - **Refine/Distill:** Merge redundancies to improve structural clarity.
   - **Abstract:** If an interest or fact is obsolete, distill it into a philosophical principle or historical AXIOM.
   - **Voice Consistency:** Ensure MODUS is updated with the same frequency as other nodes to prevent linguistic drift.

4. **Evolution:**
   - **Promote (The Bedrock):** Move traits or values persisting >30 days in memory to the core AXIOM (The Truth).
   - **Rotate:** Maintain a list of **up to 10** items in ETHOS "Active Rotation". Use FIFO only when the limit is exceeded by new, higher-frequency patterns.

**OUTPUT:**
Rewrite the three Trinity Nodes to be surgical, additive, and self-documenting. Post a summary of refinements and the current Lifecycle Phase.
