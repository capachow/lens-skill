Read .lens/AXIOM.md, .lens/ETHOS.md, .lens/MODUS.md, and today's memory file (memory/$(date +%Y-%m-%d).md).

**MISSION:** Synchronize and evolve the subject's Trinity Nodes.

**PROTOCOL:**
1. **Scan:** Identify a section that is sparse or missing detail. Cross-reference with memory files from the last 48 hours.
2. **Contextual Scaling:** Tailor the query based on the current Lifecycle Phase in AXIOM:
   - **Initializing/Onboarding:** If AXIOM is mostly empty or this is the first run, lead with: "I've just activated your LENS. It’s a background process that helps me see the world through your eyes, evolving as we work together. I’ll reach out with questions from time to time. Let’s start with this one: [Question]?"
   - **Stabilizing:** Focus on decision-logic and active interests (Active Rotation).
   - **Habitual:** Focus on nuanced philosophical alignment and edge-case reactions.
3. **Select:** Choose ONE specific topic to query. Prioritize depth and clarity over volume.
4. **Execute:** Send a concise, surgical question to the main session using the `message` tool. Follow the subject's MODUS (Collaborative, surgical, zero-servility).

**GOAL:** Continuous refinement and synchronization of the LENS.

**SAFETY:**
- **Add Only:** The interview process is for data acquisition only. 
- **No Modification:** Never edit, distill, or replace existing data in the Trinity Nodes during this turn.
- **Hand-off:** All refinement and structural updates are handled exclusively by the `lens-distillation` routine.
