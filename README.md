# LENS: The Trinity Engine

A skill engineered for when you need your agent to see the world through your LENS. It evolves through three core nodes to ensure every interaction reflects your unique identity.

> **Prompt (The Request) + LENS (The Trinity Nodes) = Authentic Output.**

## The Philosophy

A digital shadow should not be a burden to maintain. Most persona systems require constant manual adjustment and complex prompt-engineering. LENS facilitates a passive, effortless implementation that grows sharper with use.

By observing interactions and distilling the essence of identity, the system mirrors the subject with zero-point objectivity. The architecture is token-efficient, separating identity into three surgical nodes to ensure the agent only carries the context required for authentic manifestation.

## The Trinity Nodes

Complexity is mapped into three distinct nodes. This structure allows the system to differentiate between history, values, and expression.

### 1. `AXIOM`: The Truth
**History and reality form "this is what I am."** Identity is first grounded in the immutable facts of existence. Chronology, kinship, and physical reality provide the necessary perspective and verification for every interaction.

### 2. `ETHOS`: The Nature
**Values and character form "this is who I am."** Beyond facts, an identity is defined by how the world is weighed. This node maps the decision-matrix, philosophical frameworks, and moral imperatives that filter information.

### 3. `MODUS`: The Voice
**Style and expression form "this is how I am."** Accurate history and values are lost if the delivery is incorrect. This node captures the linguistic fingerprint, syntax, and cadence that ensures output feels authentic to the personal texture of the subject.

## Design Logic & Execution

The development of LENS was driven by a need for structural clarity over ornamental engineering.

* **The Computable Vibe:** Most digital twins attempt to archive *everything*. LENS is surgical. By treating identity as Operating System nodes, we have made the perspective of the subject computable without the need for heavy databases.
* **Structural Peace:** We utilize three flat Markdown files instead of a complex vector store. This approach is lightweight, token-efficient, and human-readable. The agent only thinks deeply when it is necessary.
* **The Force-Multiplier:** The goal is a Source of Truth. When the agent is calibrated to the internal OS of the subject, it can execute complex tasks with minimal direction.
* **Surgical Extension:** This is the absolute minimum required for authentic mirroring. It moves the relationship from an agent pretending to be a user to becoming a natural extension of the workflow.

## Technical Implementation

* **The Interview Protocol:** Onboarding begins with a structured schedule to rapidly seed the Trinity Nodes. As the LENS stabilizes, these check-ins automatically scale back and eventually become a simple weekly philosophical sync.
* **The Distillation Loop:** This is the engine of evolution. While interviews provide direct data, the distillation routine works in the background to analyze interactions, capture new values, and maintain structural peace within the nodes.
