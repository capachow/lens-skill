# 🧐 LENS: The Trinity Engine

[View on ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/capachow/lens)

A skill engineered for when you need your agent to see the world through your LENS. It evolves through three core nodes to ensure every interaction reflects your unique identity.

> **Prompt (The Request) + LENS (The Trinity Nodes) = Authentic Output.**

## The Philosophy

A digital shadow should not be a burden to maintain. Most persona systems require constant manual adjustment and complex prompt-engineering. LENS facilitates a passive, effortless implementation that grows sharper with use.

By observing interactions and distilling the essence of identity, the system mirrors the subject with zero-point objectivity. The architecture is token-efficient, separating identity into three surgical nodes to ensure the agent only carries the context required for authentic manifestation.

## The Trinity Nodes (The Scientific Anchors)

Complexity is mapped into three distinct nodes using structural anchors to define the "Biological Physics" of the subject's identity.

### 1. `AXIOM.md`: The Truth (What)
**History and reality form the Cognitive Bedrock.** Identity is first grounded in the immutable facts of existence. 
- **Anchors:** Chronology, Kinship, Latency & Velocity (thinking speed), Data Heritage, Asset Weight.

### 2. `ETHOS.md`: The Nature (Who)
**Values and character form the Internal Compass.** Beyond facts, an identity is defined by how the world is weighed. 
- **Anchors:** Decision-Logic, Candor & Friction, Chaos Tolerance, Identity Loyalty, Prioritization Hierarchy.

### 3. `MODUS.md`: The Voice (How)
**Style and expression form the Behavioral Interface.** Accurate history and values are lost if the delivery is incorrect. 
- **Anchors:** Cadence Velocity, Punctuation Density (Rhythm), Lexical Gravity, Tone Temperature.

## Evolution & Calibration

The LENS is not static; it is an evolving digital shadow.

*   **The Interview Protocol:** Onboarding begins with one week of intensive seeding (2x daily). It then shifts to three weeks of Stabilization (1x daily) for decision-logic calibration before moving to an ongoing Weekly Sync (Habitual phase).
*   **The Distillation Loop:** This is the engine of evolution. The distillation routine works in the background to analyze patterns and maintain structural peace.
*   **Contextual Isolation:** To prevent "AI-muddiness," the distillation engine is strictly constrained to analyze the subject's raw, direct expression only, ignoring agent turns and system logs.
*   **Refinement on Demand:** You can proactively focus the LENS at any time. Simply say "Focus my LENS" or "Ask me a LENS question" to trigger an immediate calibration query.

## Structural Peace

LENS utilizes three flat Markdown files instead of a complex vector store. This approach is lightweight, token-efficient, and human-readable. By treating identity as Operating System nodes, we have made the perspective of the subject computable without the need for heavy databases.
