# 🧐 LENS

[View on ClawHub](https://clawhub.ai/capachow/lens)

A skill engineered for when you need your agent to see the world through your LENS. It evolves through three core nodes to ensure every interaction reflects your unique identity.

> **Prompt (The Request) + LENS (The Trinity Nodes) = Authentic Output.**

## The Philosophy

A digital shadow should not be a burden to maintain. Most persona systems require manual adjustment and complex prompt-engineering. LENS is a passive, effortless implementation that grows sharper with use.

By observing interactions and distilling the essence of identity, the system mirrors the subject with zero-point objectivity. The architecture is token-efficient, separating identity into three surgical nodes to ensure the agent only carries the context required for authentic manifestation.

## The Trinity Nodes

Complexity is mapped into three distinct nodes. These anchors define the subject's identity through specific, immutable parameters.

### 1. `AXIOM.md`: The Truth (What)
**History and reality form the Cognitive Bedrock.** Identity is grounded in the immutable facts of existence.

> Chronology, Kinship, Assets, Professional Credentials, and Immutable History.

### 2. `ETHOS.md`: The Nature (Who)
**Values and character form the Internal Compass.** Identity is defined by how the world is weighed.

> Decision-Logic, Aesthetic Triggers, Philosophical Alignment, and Priority Traits.

### 3. `MODUS.md`: The Voice (How)
**Style and expression form the Behavioral Interface.** Identity is rendered through the nuance of delivery.

> Cadence Velocity, Punctuation Density, Lexical Gravity, Tone Temperature, and Linguistic Markers.

## Orchestration & State

To keep the Trinity Nodes pure, the LENS uses an isolated configuration layer:

*   **`SET.json`**: Manages the "State Machine." This file tracks your lifecycle phase, question counts, and model preferences. This separation ensures that skill updates never overwrite your identity or your settings.

## Evolution & Calibration

The LENS is not static; it is an evolving digital shadow.

*   **The Interview Protocol:** The system progresses through **onboarding** (2x daily for 1 week), **stabilizing** (1x daily for 3 weeks), and **habitual** (1x weekly) schedules to calibrate your digital shadow.
*   **The Distillation Loop:** The engine of evolution. A background routine analyzes patterns to maintain structural peace without user intervention.
*   **Contextual Isolation:** To prevent "AI-muddiness," the distillation engine strictly analyzes the subject's raw input, ignoring its own previous outputs.
*   **Silence Toggle:** You have total control. Setting `questions` to `false` in `SET.json` silences the interview routine while keeping the identity engine active.
*   **Refinement on Demand:** You can proactively sharpen the LENS at any time. Simply say **"Focus my LENS"** or **"Ask me a LENS question"** to trigger an immediate calibration.

## Structural Peace

LENS utilizes three flat Markdown files and a single JSON state file instead of a complex vector store. This approach is lightweight, token-efficient, and human-readable. By treating identity as Operating System nodes, we have made the perspective of the subject computable without the need for heavy databases.
